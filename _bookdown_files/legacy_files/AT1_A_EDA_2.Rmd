## 1. Undertake EDA on this dataset. 

## a. Do you need to clean the data in any way? Justify what you decide to do (or not do). 

### Prep
```{r Prep}
#import
transactions <- read_csv("transactions.csv")

# convert dates to dates
transactions$date <- as.Date(transactions$date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")

#change variable name to avoid conflicts
tname <- names(transactions)
tname[1] <- "trdate"
names(transactions) <- tname

# convert neccessary variables to factors
transactions$customer_id <- as.factor(transactions$customer_id) 
transactions$industry <- as.factor(transactions$industry)
transactions$location <- as.factor(transactions$location)
```


## b. Describe two insights gained just from EDA that would be of interest to the sales manager.
